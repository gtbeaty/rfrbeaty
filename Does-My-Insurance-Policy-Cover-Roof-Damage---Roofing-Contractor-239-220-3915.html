The same basics that apply to your roof, may apply to your exterior property.Although hail, wind, and rain are covered by your home insurance policy, there are many factors that determine if your damage will be covered, and if so, how much you will be reimbursed.Some policies take the age of your roof into account at the time it is damaged. For example, if your roof is under 10 years old, you may be covered for the full cost of repairing or replacing the damaged section of your roof at the time of the claim. You may only be reimbursed for the depreciated value of the damaged roof if your roof is over 10 years old. The depreciated value takes the aging and wearing of your roof into account, meaning its value has decreased prior to any damage occurring. Depending on where you live, some policies will only offer roof damage coverage up to the depreciated value, regardless of the age of your roof. Other policies will cover the full cost of repairing or replacing the damaged section of your roof at the time of the claim, regardless of the age of your roof. Your insurance company will send an inspector to your home to investigate and verify your claim. If the damage is determined to be from aging, wear and tear, or poor condition of your roof, it will typically be considered normal maintenance, and will not be covered under your policy.Paul Marcum Construction LLC24475 Rocky RdBonita Springs, Florida 34135Call: (239) 220-3915 Open Hours: 9AM-8PMhttps://rooferalliance.comhttps://goo.gl/maps/uemr43YD52w<br><br><p><a href="https://rfrbeaty.blob.core.windows.net/rfrbeaty/Does-My-Insurance-Policy-Cover-Roof-Damage---Roofing-Contractor-239-220-3915.html">Bonita Springs Roofing Contractor</a><br> <a href="https://rfrbeaty.blob.core.windows.net/rfrbeaty/Does-My-Insurance-Policy-Cover-Roof-Damage---Roofing-Contractor-239-220-3915.html">Bonita Springs Roofer</a><br> <a href="https://rfrbeaty.blob.core.windows.net/rfrbeaty/Does-My-Insurance-Policy-Cover-Roof-Damage---Roofing-Contractor-239-220-3915.html">Roofing Contractor Bonita Springs</a><br> <a href="https://rfrbeaty.blob.core.windows.net/rfrbeaty/Does-My-Insurance-Policy-Cover-Roof-Damage---Roofing-Contractor-239-220-3915.html">Roofing Company Bonita Springs</a><br> <a href="https://rfrbeaty.blob.core.windows.net/rfrbeaty/Does-My-Insurance-Policy-Cover-Roof-Damage---Roofing-Contractor-239-220-3915.html">Lee County Roofing Contractor</a><br> <a href="https://rfrbeaty.blob.core.windows.net/rfrbeaty/Does-My-Insurance-Policy-Cover-Roof-Damage---Roofing-Contractor-239-220-3915.html">Lee County Roofer</a><br> </p><br></body><br></html>
